--------------------------------------------

 It's never too later to start !  

Today I read a blog [Kitten's 时间胶囊](http://www.kittenyang.com/) , although the author is yong (born on 1994) , but I think his thought is mature .  
I can't help thinking of myself . I am thirty years old , I am alrady a father , but I am still childish , selfish , self-indulgent and hedonistic ，nothing achived .  
As the Kitten discribed his life in junior of his university , he always indulged in wechat, RenRen and such kind of socail apps , to discover other's life , browse gossip, all this will make you feel purposeless and empty, and the more you feel purposeless and empty , the more you use and depend on social apps .

Kitten is yong , but he alreay know that , how come I can't get away from this useless things ? I don't have so much time to waste as a ignorant one .

Less use of social apps . 
Read more books and blog by outstanding/excelent person .
Hard working and hard playing .
